                      establish and why? What is the duration of the
                      accommodation plan? Did you provide the student with any

          Complete any follow-up actions as agreed or needed. Do you need to
          consult with the exams team? Do you need to consult with the
          Coordinator or Manager? Do you have to submit a referral to the
          Adapted Technology Centre? Begin gathering information for a bursary
          application?

          Lastly, change the event status of the student's appointment to
          Completed on your Ventus calendar. To do so, click on the student's
          appointment, event status and select <em>follow up complete</em>.

                      You did it! You've completed the initial meeting and changed its event status to <em>follow up complete</em>, now what? Do you ever meet with the student again? As part of the accommodation plan, regular check-ins, <em>also known as follow-ups</em>, are recommended to ensure that your student is supported throughout the first few months or their academic accommodation journey. You may schedule follow-up appointments for the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Modifying or renewing academic accommodation plans:</strong> Whether the student has updated documentation, no longer requires a support, or needs to make changes to current supports.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Learning Strategies:</strong> Perhaps the student wishes to come up with a plan to organize their materials, course notes, or work on exam study strategies.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Bursaries:</strong> The need to discuss bursary supports for disability-related assistive technology or services such as note takers, tutors, educational assistants. 
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Follow-up meetings can be scheduled weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or on an as-need basis. However, it is important that you and your students think proactively instead of reactively, as this will help you both in the long run should any situation arise (ex: students not confirming exams on time).
