                      After reviewing the disability documentation in the
                      Disabilities Tab on Ventus, determine if the disability is
                      primary or secondary. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to
                      ask the student to confirm. Then, you'll need to determine
                      if the disability/condition is either permanent or
                      temporary - Why is this important?

                      <li>
                        If the disability/condition is permanent, and the
                        documentation is up to date, you can consider
                        establishing the academic accommodation plan for the
                        duration of their studies at UO (4-5 years)

                      <li>
                        If the documentation is up to date, but the medical
                        specialist checked off "temporary/duration unknown", you
                        will establish accommodations for one semester (unless
                        there is a specific date written). The student will need
                        to provide you with updated documentation for future
                        terms.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the medical documentation is outdated, interim
                        acccommodations will be in place for one semester while
                        the student seeks new documentation.

                    <p>
                      Mark the disability category (or categories) and
                      supporting medical documentation as verified. Include an
                      expiry date, if applicable.
