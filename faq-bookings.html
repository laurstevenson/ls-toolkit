        Buffer times are extra times added at the end of each appointment to help you finish any notes, POCs, or tasks related to the meeting. For now, there are 15-minute buffer times at the end of most appointments and 20-minute buffer times following an Initial or General/Consult.

          We've run into situations where students needing an initial appointment would schedule a follow-up meeting instead, likely because this appointment type was available earlier. Our emails and communication to all students state that, should the wrong appointment type be booked, we will cancel the meeting and resend the Bookings link. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For Initials, File Transfer. and General/Consult appointments, we are sharing a specific link to that particular appointment type. This has helped limit this type of situation from happening as often as before. <em>Note:</em> if a student reschedules their meeting, they'll have access to all appointment types in your Bookings Page.

          For the time being, Bookings does not have a way to mark a no-show in your calendar. You'll need to create an event in your Ventus calendar, enter the student's information, appointment type, lastly mark the status as <em>no show</em>.

          Please be sure to share your Outlook calendar with your manager and the Operations Reception Portfolio Lead! This way, we can easily see your schedules meetings with students.

          The Reception Lead will reschedule any initial or general consultation with the Learning Specialist on-call. All other appointment types will be cancelled and rescheduled with you.

          In order to access your MS Bookings Page in the first place, students must login using their UO credentials. However, once they're in, they can use and enter any email address to book the appointment itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've added a mandatory field with the goal of reminding students that they must use their UO credentials in order to receive a confirmation email. We've found that this has helped limit this type of hiccup!
