        Students receive this accommodation to help compensate for the extra time they lose due to their disability while completing scheduled academic tasks. Granting extra time ensures that the student is not unfairly penalized for having to use alternate means to access written materials to complete their work.
      </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Who can receive this accommodation?</strong>
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Compromised reading abilities arising from a learning disorder
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluctuating and unpredictable periods of ill-health associated with mental health disabilitis or chronic illnesses, such as Crohn's Disease
        </li>
        <li>
          Impairments making it difficult to focus and concentrate for sustained periods of time
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduced or limited stamina due to physical disabilities or injuries
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliance on adapted technologies to read and/or write
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How much extra time should instructors grant?</strong>
      </p>
        <p>
          While there is no set formula, the amount of time granted for each extension needs to consider stated expectations of the assignments and the course. This helps ensure the student remains on track with course content and received feedback needed to progress. Extra time on assignments does not mean:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open ended deadlines</li>
        <li>Elimination of all in-course deadlines or permission to submit interval-scheduled work all at the same time at the end of the course</li>
        <li>Permission to submit assignments at the student's convenience</li>
        <li>Submitting assignments after answers have been posted or other students have received feedback on their work</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Students must ask instructors for extensions even if SASS - Academic Accommodations has approved this accommodation</strong><br>
          Students are required to negotiate each and every deadline extension with their professors. Also, they must provide our letter of support to each professor where assignments are tied directly to the academic standards and requirements of their course.

          Students with disabilities may require a reduced course load to better manage the impact of their disability. taking fewer courses in a given semester can often make their academic journey more manageable. A reduced course load recommendation (4 courses or part-time studies) <strong>must</strong> be clearly outlined in the medical documentation. A reduced course load does not mean that the student is considered <em>full-time</em> but rather have access to the same benefits as full-time students.
