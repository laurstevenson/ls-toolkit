        This accommodation permits students additonal
        time beyond the period set by instructors for an exam. The core purpose
        of extra time as an accommodation is to equalize access to the exam
        process.<br />
        Extra time compensates students for time they lose during an exam when
        coping with functional limitations that stem from their disability.<br />
        It is not granted to give students an academic advantage, or to help
        students improve their exam performance.<br />
        <strong>Who receives this accommodation?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reading or information processing disabilities; who require more time
          to read and comprehend exam questions
        </li>
        <li>
          Written expression disabilities; who require more time to formulate
          and convey their responses
        </li>
        <li>
          Mental health disabilities; who need additional time to use strategies
          for symptom management, such as calming or breathing techniques
        </li>
        <li>
          Chronic pain, concussions, or other physical disabilities where pain
          may slow cognition and focus
        </li>
        <li>
          Attention deficits, concussions, or autism which may interfere with
          concentration and focus
        </li>
        <li>
          Vision loss requiring the use of adaptive technology or individualized
          support to access exam content and/or communicate their responses
        </li>
        <li>
          Medical needs requiring monitoring such as blood sugar levels or pain
        </li>
        <li>
          Temporary injuries, such as hand or arm injuries, where graphomotor
          abilities may be hampered
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How much extra time do students get?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The amount of extra time students receive as an accommodation is informed both by their disability documentation and lived experince of a disability</li>
        <li>Based on current findings, up to 25% extended time is sufficient to address MOST exam-related barriers experienced by university students with disabilities (Lovett & Lewandowski, 2014)</li>
        <li>Students with more signifiant functional limitations may be granted time and a half. Similarly, only students with very significant functional limitations or access barriers, well supported by detailed documentation, receive greater than 1.5x.</li>
      </ul>

          This accommodation refers to information that students, whose memory retrieval is impaired due to a disability, are permitted to bring and use during an exam/midterm/quiz. That means they generally do not include references to processes, or relationships/associations themselves, but act as a trigger for whatever strategy students have developed to retrieve the information needed. This also satisfies the requirement of being a unique clue that no one else understands. This is different from simply using pictures, arrows or acronyms to rewrite information a student may have trouble remembering - that's the role of cheat sheets, not memory-aid sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Who can receive this accommodation?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students with neurological impairment that interferes with their spontaneous retrieval of learned information may be approved for this support. Low scores on measures of "working memory" and "auditory working memory" are not sufficient evidence to support the need for this accommodation. Working memory does not require actual storage of information. Auditory working memory does not require the transferral of temporarily-held information into long-term storage.
