        Begin your meeting with an ice breaker, get to know your student! After
        all, you'll be working with them throughout their studies. Ask them
        about their program, long term goals, hobbies, etc.

        <li>
          Provide a brief overview of the Learning Specialists role, their
          professors role, and most importantly, the student's role in the
          accommodation process. We work co-operatively with the university
          community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assist with disability-related bursary applications, when applicable.
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>Confidentiality</li>
        <li>
          Define our scope: Academic Accommodations tied to course & course
          related activities, such as exams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain that Academic Accommodations are put in place to equalize
          learning opportunities for students with visible and non-visible
          disabilities. This often involves removing barriers caused by
          functional limitations, so students have access to the academic
          environment. Students with accommodations must meet all academic
          requirements and standards of their courses. Accommodations do not
          guarantee academic achievement; students with accommodations will
          experience similar challenges and successes as their peers do in their
          programs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, share that the academic accommodation plan is individualized.
          Two students who may share the same diagnosis do not necessarily share
          the same challenges and strengths, this is why, for example, their
          accommodations could differ.
        </li>
      </ul>
          <p>
        Before you activate the student's Ventus profile, make sure you discuss
        the option to opt-out of accommodations. If a student no longer wishes
        to receive accommodations, and no longer wants their professors to know
        that they are registered with our service, students can opt-out at any
        point. Asked them to fill out and sign the "opt-out" form and include it
        in a POC.

        Assess academic accommodations need<br>
        & activate Ventus profile
      </h2>
      <p>
        Discuss the duration of teaching and exam accommodations with the
        student (permanent or temporary).<br />
        If permanent, discuss with them whether you'd like to review
        accommodations after each academic year, or, establish supports for the
        duration of their studies.<br />
        If temporary, explain why to the student (be sure to include this in
        your POC!) temporary accommodations are established for a number of
        reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Student has a temporary disability/condition</li>
        <li>
          An updated psycho-educational assessment is required and explain next
          steps such as referrals and possible funding application (i.e. Student
          was last assessed as a child or prior to 18 years of age/and is more
          than 5 years old)
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain limitations tied to the temporary status and inform the
          student that updated or proper documentation is required.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Academic Accommodation plan is a working 'document', inform the
        student that current supports established can be modified, if needed,
        subject to documented changes in the medical condition, course related
        content/context, and course format.

          <p>
        Here, you'll discuss disability-related needs in a university context.
        It is also important to set expectations and discuss differences between
        secondary and post-secondary studies, as accommodation plans could vary.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help you in determining an appropriate accommodation plan, it is
        important to ask a lot of questions. Don't be shy! This is by no means
        an exhaustive list of questions you could ask. The possibilities are
        endless! As a starting point, begin with...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have you received accommodations in the past? If yes, which ones?
          Which were the most helpful and why?
        </li>
        <li>What (disability-related) challenges are you facing?</li>
        <li>
          What has your experience been like in the classroom environment? What
          strategies do you use to stay organized, manage your time, study, take
          notes?
        </li>
        <li>
          What has your experience been like in the exam environment? What
          strategies do you use to manage stress levels, keep track of time,
          remain focused?
        </li>
        <li>Side effects from medications? Sleep schedule/Daily routine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Make sure that you write down important information that will help you
        in creating the accommodation plan and to justify why these
        accommodations were chosen.

      <p>
        After you have agreed on the exam accommodation plan, you'll need to
        activate these supports via the 'Exam Accommodations' tab on Ventus.
        Select on the exam accommodations and enter an expiry date. Make sure
        that the Exam Accommodations are saved and active (should appear as
        green)
      </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>reminder</strong>, temporary accommodations are typically established for one semester. Permanent supports are typically established for the expected duration of their program. However, you may choose to establish and revisit accommodation supports each year, if that's the case enter an expiry date after one full academic year and explain to the student the justification.

          <p>
            In short, students have the option to write with or without established exam accommodations. The procedure, outlined in greater detail on our <a href="https://sass.uottawa.ca/en/access/adapted-exams">website</a>, is as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At least 10 calendar days prior to a test, professors/faculties submit a Notice of Examination in <strong>their</strong> Ventus portal</li>
            <li>Students receive an email from Ventus asking them to confirm their participation and accommodations</li>
            <li>Students have to confirm each exam by the following deadlines: <strong>seven days</strong> prior to each midterm/quiz/deferred exam, <strong>November 15th</strong> for Fall term final exams, <strong>March 15th</strong> for Winter term final exams</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          If a student forgets to confirm an exam, there is no guarantee that an exception could be made. Encourage your students to frequently check their emails and booksmart Ventus on their browser.
