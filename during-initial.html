      Begin your meeting with an ice breaker, get to know your student! After all, you'll be working with them throughout their studies. Ask them about their program, long term goals, hobbies, etc. 
    </p>
    <h5>
      Set clear expectations and provide general (but pertinent) information:
    </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a brief overview of SASS - Academic Accommodations</li>
      <li>Provide a brief overview of the Learning Specialists role, their professors role, and most importantly, the student's role in the accommodation process. We work co-operatively with the university community.</li>
      <li>Assist with disability-related bursary applications, when applicable.</li>
      <li>Share campus and community resources and referrals, when applicable.</li>
      <li>Confidentiality</li>
      <li>Define our scope: Academic Accommodations tied to course & course related activities, such as exams.</li>
      <li>Explain that Academic Accommodations are put in place to equalize learning opportunities for students with visible and non-visible disabilities. This often involves removing barriers caused by functional limitations, so students have access to the academic environment. Students with accommodations must meet all academic requirements and standards of their courses. Accommodations do not guarantee academic achievement; students with accommodations will experience similar challenges and successes as their peers do in their programs.</li>
      <li>Lastly, share that the academic accommodation plan is individualized. Two students who may share the same diagnosis do not necessarily share the same challenges and strengths, this is why, for example, their accommodations could differ.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before you activate the student's Ventus profile, make sure you discuss the option to opt-out of accommodations. If a student no longer wishes to receive accommodations, and no longer wants their professors to know that they are registered with our service, students can opt-out at any point. Asked them to fill out and sign the "opt-out" form and include it in a POC.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Activate their Profile & Assess Academic Accommodations Need
    </h5>
    <p>
      Discuss the duration of teaching and exam accommodations with the student (permanent or temporary).<br>
      If permanent, discuss with them whether you'd like to review accommodations after each academic year, or, establish supports for the duration of their studies.<br>
      If temporary, explain why to the student (be sure to include this in your POC!)
 temporary accommodations are established for a number of reasons:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Student has a temporary disability/condition</li>
      <li>An updated psycho-educational assessment is required and explain next steps such as referrals and possible funding application (i.e. Student was last assessed as a child or prior to 18 years of age/and is more than 5 years old)</li>
      <li>Explain limitations tied to the temporary status and inform the student that updated or proper documentation is required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Academic Accommodation plan is a working 'document', inform the student that current supports established can be modified, if needed, subject to documented changes in the medical condition, course related content/context, and course format.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Engage in a collaborative discussion with the student
    </h5>
    <p>
      Here, you'll discuss disability-related needs in a university context. It is also important to set expectations and discuss differences between secondary and post-secondary studies, as accommodation plans could vary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you in determining an appropriate accommodation plan, it is important to ask a lot of questions. Don't be shy! This is by no means an exhaustive list of questions you could ask. The possibilities are endless! As a starting point, begin with...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you received accommodations in the past? If yes, which ones? Which were the most helpful and why?</li>
      <li>What (disability-related) challenges are you facing?</li>
      <li>What has your experience been like in the classroom environment? What strategies do you use to stay organized, manage your time, study, take notes?</li>
      <li>What has your experience been like in the exam environment? What strategies do you use to manage stress levels, keep track of time, remain focused?</li>
      <li>Side effects from medications? Sleep schedule/Daily routine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Make sure that you write down important information that will help you in creating the accommodation plan and to justify why these accommodations were chosen.

    <h5>
      Establish Exam Accommodations
    </h5>
    
    <p>
     After you have agreed on the exam accommodation plan, you'll need to activate these supports via the 'Exam Accommodations' tab on Ventus.<br>
      Select on the exam accommodations and enter an expiry date. Make sure that the Exam Accommodations are saved and active (should appear as green)
    </p>
    <p>
      Extended time on Exams: This accommodation permits students additonal time beyond the period set by instructors for an exam. The core purpose of extra time as an accommodation is to equalize access to the exam process.<br>
      Extra time compensates students for time they lose during an exam when coping with functional limitations that stem from their disability.<br>
      It is not granted to give students an academic advantage, or to help students improve their exam performance.<br>
      <strong>Who receives this accommodation?</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading or information processing disabilities; who require more time to read and comprehend exam questions</li>
      <li>Written expression disabilities; who require more time to formulate and convey their responses</li>
      <li>Mental health disabilities; who need additional time to use strategies for symptom management, such as calming or breathing techniques</li>
      <li>Chronic pain, concussions, or other physical disabilities where pain may slow cognition and focus</li>
      <li>Attention deficits, concussions, or autism which may interfere with concentration and focus</li>
      <li>Vision loss requiring the use of adaptive technology or individualized support to access exam content and/or communicate their responses</li>
      <li>Medical needs requiring monitoring such as blood sugar levels or pain</li>
      <li>Temporary injuries, such as hand or arm injuries, where graphomotor abilities may be hampered</li>
