      But wait! There's more...
    </h4>
  
    <p>
      Disability documentation may need to be updated over time to ensure that accommodation plans continue to meet the student's access needs. It is important to note that a disability must be related to a diagnosed condition. Although students are not required to disclose their medical diagnosis to receive academic accommodations, they must disclose disability-related functional limitations and the disability category.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>functional limitation</strong> is any restriction stemming from a disability that limits a person's ability to perform activities necessary to access and participate in the university learning environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have a general idea of why we need medical documentation, and what medical documentation should include, look over the <a class="link-effect" href="https://sass.uottawa.ca/en/access/register/required-documentation">required documentation grid</a>
       on our website. There, you'll find the different disability categories, the specific type of documentation we'll accept based on the disability category, and information regarding who can fill out the type of documentation requested. If the documentation does not correspond to our criteria or no documentation is provided, change the appointment type to a General Consult.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="neatFont2">
      Example: Incomplete Documentation
    </h4>
    <p>
      In some cases, you will receive incomplete or very limited documentation. Look over the example below, can you think of what might be missing? what information should be provided?
    </p>
    <img class="documentation" src="https://cdn.glitch.me/b05efcea-bfa4-496d-ac87-a5bffde1de59%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-16%20at%209.33.25%20AM.png?v=1637089001724" alt="prescription note from doctor">
     <h4 class="neatFont2">
      Example: Complete Documentation
    </h4>
    <p>
      Ideally, and when applicable, students will ask their healthcare practitioner to fill out a copy of our medical certificates. Here, we see:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Diagnosis and duration clearly indicated</li>
      <li>Information regarding functional limitations completed</li>
      <li>Student signature, physician signature and contact information</li>
      <li>Course load recommendation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In your opinion, is there anything that could be improved in the example below? In order to complete your assessment, what additional information would you want to see?

      Preparing for your Initial Meeting
    </h1>
                 <p class="spacing-info">
      After reviewing the disability documentation in the Disabilities Tab on Ventus, determine if the disability is primary or secondary. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask the student to confirm. Then, you'll need to determine if the disability/condition is either permanent or temporary - Why is this important?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the disability/condition is permanent, and the documentation is up to date, you can consider establishing the academic accommodation plan for the duration of their studies at UO (4-5 years)</li>
      <li>If the documentation is up to date, but the medical specialist checked off "temporary/duration unknown", you will establish accommodations for one semester (unless there is a specific date written). The student will need to provide you with updated documentation for future terms.</li>
      <li>If the medical documentation is outdated, interim acccommodations will be in place for one semester while the student seeks new documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Mark the disability category (or categories) and supporting medical documentation as verified. Include an expiry date, if applicable.

      Create a Point of Contact (POC) - Initial 
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is where you will write all of your pre-meeting notes in Ventus. There is an <a class="link-effect" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SRbtfNnS2Nf4cRt0AyLMfqWxfQnjXyxJ/view?usp=sharing">initial appointment template</a> for you to follow, but feel free to make changes or modifications to best suit your style.</p> 
    
    <p>Prior to the meeting, you'll need to make notes about:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Information from the disability documentation, such as: Diagnosis (if shared), duration, health professional's contact/registration, functional limitations and any recommendations</li>
      <li>Check the student Profile Tab to learn about the individual (program, year, hometown, status)</li>
      <li>Review the Intake Form: The student may have shared information on previous accommodations, learning skills and lifestyle information. Make notes of points to be discussed with the student during the initial appointment</li>
      <li>Assess <em>possible</em> Academic Accommodation Needs (based on documentation, self-assessment, prevous adapted measures)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Your notes are prepped and now you're ready to meet with the student! What happens next? Click on the Initial appointment link to read through what happens during the initial meeting. There, we'll review what information to share with students during this meeting, what questions should I be asking the student, and how to set up the academic accommodation plan.
